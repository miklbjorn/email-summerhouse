<git usage>
- you will typically be prompted to work on a specific issue, from the github issues.
- always work by pulling latest main branch, checking out a separate branch, make changes, rebase on main, then make PR towards ´main´
- use git worktrees when doing so to allow for multiple concurrent edits
- never include references to claude in commit messages and PRs
